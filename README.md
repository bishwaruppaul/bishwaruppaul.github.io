This is my personal website, created using R Markdown in Rstudio.

The site has been created using Flatly theme from Bootswatch.

The whole R project is contained in the repository <a href='https://github.com/bishwaruppaul/My-Website_R-project'>My Website_R-project</a>. This repository contains only the files from the folder _site.
