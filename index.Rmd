I am a research scholar, interested in studying the behavioural ecology, evolution and cognition of group-living and social animals.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Biology, IISER Tirupati, studying the behavioural ecology of Indian squirrels.

I studied the behavioural ecology of ants for my PhD thesis in the Department of Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata. I investigated different aspects of the behaviour of brood theft in an ant species.
